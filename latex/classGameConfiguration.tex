Interface that provides unified interface to clients wanting to read game configurations. Game\+Config is the Strategy participant in the Strategy design pattern used to model accessing the game configuration. The Concrete\+Strategies that inherit from this interface can load the configuration in any necessary mode, thus ensuring extensibility (i.\+e. JSON file config, web config, interface remains the same)
